I am a fourth-year Ph.D student at Peking University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qingni Shen](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/1634-%E6%B2%88%E6%99%B4%E9%9C%93.html) and work closely with [Zhi Zhang](https://zhangzhics.github.io/). I was also a visting Ph.D student at National University of Singapore advised by Prof. [Trevor E. Carlson](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tcarlson/) from October 2024 to October 2025. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Security from Hunan University.

My research interests are in system security and computer architecture. In particular, I focus on re-evaluating the rationale behind certain hardware designs, and uncovering new side-channel leakages to offer designers insights for building more secure systems.

 For more details, you can refer to my [CV](https://zhangxin00.github.io/files/ZhangXin_CV.pdf).
I know little about other "fancy/non-fancy" and "hot/cold" areas. The only exception is that I occasionally collaborate with my friends on some cross-cutting topics that intersect with system security. -->
